## Lesson 1: Setup and Overview

### Setup 
First, let's assume you already have basic knowledge about Project Firefly and how to create a project through Adobe Developer Console using template. Follow [this](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/runtime/docs.html#!adobedocs/adobeio-runtime/master/getting-started/setup.md) to setup your cli with Runtime plugin which is required as pre-requisite. The runtime cli will enable you create a runtime action and hook it up with an integration via Adobe Developer Console. 


### Overview
This codelab will take you through the I/O events SYNC webhook registration using your own runtime actions via console.
As part of this codelab, we will cover all the behind the scene actions happening for the below 

- Using firefly template `publish-event`as custom event [this](https://adobeio-codelabs-custom-events-adobedocs.project-helix.page/?src=/lessons/lesson1.html)
- Setting up event registration follow Follow [this](https://adobeio-codelabs-custom-events-adobedocs.project-helix.page/?src=/lessons/lesson2.html)
